## Introduction
Star Wars API Search is an easy to use app which allows for easier character lookups. Even for big Star Wars fans, this app will make it easier to learn about and find character that we may not yet have heard of. You can search for characters in the search bar, or you can view the list of Star Wars characters if you are not sure where to look.

## Use Case
Why is the app useful? It takes data from multiple Star Wars sources and puts it into one. Instead of having to search those multiple sources, you can find what you need using this app.

The app is responsive and will scale with different size devices.

## Technical
* The app is built using JQuery, Javascript, HTML, CSS and Express. DOM manupulation and AJAX calls handled via JQuery.
* The app is fully responsive, adapting for mobile, table and desktop viewports.
* The search bar uses EasyAutoComplete to list characters relevant to the search.
* The API's used are the Wikia API, Bing Image Search API, and the StarWarsAPI.
* Express server used to make API calls to Wikia API because of CORS.

## Upcoming Features
* Provide more data to the users for each character.
* Add more intereactive features such as videos.
